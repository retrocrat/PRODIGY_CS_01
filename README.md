#Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest encryption methods, named after Julius Caesar, who used it to secure his military messages. This cipher involves shifting each letter in the alphabet by a set number of positions. For instance, with a shift of three, ‘A’ becomes ‘D’, ‘B’ becomes ‘E’, and so forth. While straightforward, the Caesar Cipher laid the foundation for modern cryptographic practices. In this article, we’ll delve into the mechanics of the Caesar Cipher, its historical importance, and its influence on cryptography, including its strengths and weaknesses.
